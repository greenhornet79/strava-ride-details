This plugin allows you to display Strava ride details from a specific ride in your posts and pages using a shortcode.

== Description ==

Strava Ride Details allows you to display Strava ride details from a specific ride in your posts and pages using a shortcode. It uses v3 of Strava's API, and uses OAuth for authentication. 

The details displayed by default are:

*   Ride Name
*   Distance
*   Elevation Gain
*   Moving Time
*   Location

Each of the details can be turned on or off. The details are displayed in an unordered list so you can style the elements however you would like using CSS.

While Strava does offer their own embed widget, this plugin:

* does not require an iframe
* allows you to style the results to match your site
* will work in responsive themes


By default all details are display using the shortcode `[strava id="ride_id"]`, where ride_id is the string of digits at the end of the URL when viewing a single ride on Strava.

If you would like to remove a detail, just set it to false in the shortcode. For example, if you would like to show only the distance, then use this shortcode:

`[strava id="ride_id" name="false" elevation="false" moving_time="false" location="false"]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `strava-ride-details` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
